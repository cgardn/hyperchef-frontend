# Hyperchef frontend

Hyperchef is a recipe website I built after getting tired of slogging through endless ads and prose on most other recipe sites. It's also a place for me to store all our favorite recipes instead of in a binder on top of the refrigerator!

Upcoming features include:
- weekly meal planning
- grocery list generation
- many more recipes
- user accounts for saving favorite recipes (right now all the recipes are already my favorites :))
